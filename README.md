A small showcase of much of what I've done in code for Linux classes.

This code automatically launches a full network featuring a web server, LDAP, load balancing, SQL server, and monitoring support on GCloud if the master.sh bash script is run and given full permissions in a fresh Gcloud instance.

All servers are made to run on the smallest tier of instance for cost savings.
