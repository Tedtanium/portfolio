A small showcase of what I've done recently for work and personal projects.

modules - A small sample of Terraform usage set up for an AWS environment. 

ansible - A small sample of Ansible usage for RHEL AWS EC2 instances.

bedrock-manipulator - an ad-hoc PowerShell script created to automate SSH workloads over hundreds of EC2 instances before we were enabled greater forms of automation.

gatekeeper-bot - a Discord bot written in Python used in the past to manage user access and save files to private game servers such as ARK, Minecraft, and Starbound. Users are capable of provisioning the server to be run via Discord message.
